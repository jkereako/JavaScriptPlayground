# JavaScriptPlayground
Small project to test JavaScript locally.

# How to use
There are two ways to use this project.

1. Open index.html in your browser
2. Run the web server.

This web server is a CORS work-around. It allows you to fetch local files with
XmlHttpRequest.

To run the webserver, you'll need Python 3.

```sh
$> python servery.py
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

That's it!
