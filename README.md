# JavaScriptPlayground
Small project to test JavaScript locally. There's probably a better way to do this.

# How to use
To run the webserver, you'll need Python.

```sh
$> python servery.py
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

This webserver allows all origins, so it gets around CORS.
